# Cryptocurrencies
BootCamp Week 18. Unsupervised Machine Learning 

# Overview
Cryptocurrencies is a trending market and its very easy to get confused among all the different options that the market have. In this project, we were asked to create a report about all the cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how could be grouped in a more understandable to a potential clients. Since we donÂ´t have a known output, I will use Unsupervised Machine Learning to group the cryptocurrencies using a clustering K-means algorithm and data visualization to show the results. 

The steps to process this data were:
  1. Preprocess the data to get it able to ML Analysis.
  2. Reducing data dimensions using PCA (Personal Component Analysis)
  3. Clustering data using K-means Algorithm
  4. Visualizing Results.
